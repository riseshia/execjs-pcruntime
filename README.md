# ExecJS::PCRuntime

Accelerated ExecJS Runtime by launching Node.js Processes per Context, not per execution.

inspired by [execjs-fastnode](https://github.com/jhawthorn/execjs-fastnode)

## Requirements

# XXX: Let's specify supported execjs version as well as Ruby version.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'execjs-pcruntime'
```

And then execute:
```
$ bundle
```

## Usage

Once installed, the Runtime will automatically be replaced.
If you want to set it, you can use environment variable `EXECJS_RUNTIME=PCRuntime`.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

### Test

XXX: This gem can't be to tested on Ruby 3.2 :thinking-face:
XXX: How about add test GitHub Actions for supported ruby version?
